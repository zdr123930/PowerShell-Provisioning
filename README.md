# ENTERPRISE PROVISIONING & AUTOMATION TOOLKIT

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of PowerShell-based provisioning and lifecycle management tools designed to automate common IT operations tasks within an Active Directory / Microsoft 365 environment.

The toolkit focuses on reducing manual administrative effort, improving consistency, and standardizing user and device lifecycle processes.

## Included Tools

* Password management
* User account creation
* User account enablement
* Device enable / disable management
* Organizational leaver processing
* Central program launcher (ties all tools together)

Each tool has its own folder and individual README with detailed documentation.

## Design Approach

The scripts are structured to demonstrate:

* Modular development
* Reusable functions
* Structured input handling (CSV where applicable)
* Object-based logic (arrays / hashtables)
* Consistent error handling

The goal is to reflect real-world enterprise automation practices while keeping all data sanitized and non-production.

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates practical automation patterns used in enterprise IT environments and reflects a transition from operational support work to engineering-focused automation solutions.

## Security Note

All scripts use placeholder data only. No production tenant information or proprietary business logic is included.
